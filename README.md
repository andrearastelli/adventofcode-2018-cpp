## Why C++ and goals of this project
C++ is a great programming language, and in the past few years went through a lot of change and improvement.
The goal of this project is to go and take my time trying to finish the _Advent of Code 2018_ using only **C++**, and widen my knowledge of the language and improve my algorythm design.
All being said, another goal of this project is to try and think about solutions, in the most general way possible. This means, mostly, trying to avoid any super optimized code, any parallel code and all other possible way to "waste time" in the development that are not focused on the simplest solution to each given problem.

## Why non-optimized code?
Basically, in order to design a well optimized algorythm, you need to spend time and mental resources, trying to find the best solution possible that can be processed in the least amount of computing time possible.
This requires a very good knowledge of the problem, and a reasonable amount of time.
Such properties, I already know that, will not be in my time-budget.
I want to spend the least possible amount of time on each problem, instead of focusing on every problem trying to improve the algorythm in order to run it as fast as possible.
Also, quite ofter, fast means parallelized, and parallelized means a change of mindset in order to decompose the problem such that can be fetched into a well and scalable multithreaded code.
So, even though my goal is to widen my knowledge of the modern C++, I also want to delegate my learning of multithreading programming to another king of task.
